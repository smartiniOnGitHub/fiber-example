## Problems with Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and Go installed via Snap

If VSCode (using Go extension) is not able to install required tools, you can use the following trick:
open VSCode User Settings () `settings.json` , search for Go and then set:

```
    "go.alternateTools": {
        "go": "/snap/go/current/bin/go"
    },
 ```

then restart VSCode; all should be fine now.


In VSCode it seems imports are not resolved, probably due to a misconfiguration 
or sources here are not in the right folder, anyway all works and builds the same.
To get some help from current Go environment do: `go env`.


Go module here has been set to 'example.com', just to set a value.
